**Live Site:** [http://a1-thecoolbt.glitch.me](http://a1-thecoolbt.glitch.me)

## Overview

This project implements a static webpage served using a Node.js server. The page is styled using a custom color palette and Google Fonts. It also includes a JavaScript animation, and various semantic HTML tags to enhance the structure and presentation of the content.

## Technical Achievements

### 1. **Styled Page with CSS**
   - **Global Styles:** Applied a global font family, background color, and text color to create a consistent look throughout the site.
   - **Box Shadow on Headings:** Added a text-shadow to `h1` and `h2` elements to create a subtle depth effect, making the headings stand out.
   - **List Styling:** Customized the appearance of unordered lists (`ul`) with padding, margin, and a specific color for list items (`li`), improving readability.
   - **Link Styling:** Styled the links (`a` tags) with custom colors and added a hover effect that changes the color and underlines the text to enhance user interaction.
   - **Experience Section Border:** Encapsulated the experience section with a border and background color, providing visual separation and emphasis.

### 2. **JavaScript Animation**
   - Implemented a simple JavaScript animation that gradually changes the background color of the webpage at regular intervals. This animation adds a dynamic and visually appealing element to the otherwise static content.

### 3. **Enhanced with Semantic HTML Tags**
   - **`header` Tag:** Wrapped the main heading and introductory paragraph in a `header` tag to semantically group the introductory content.
   - **`nav` Tag:** Added a navigation bar with links to different sections of the page, enhancing the page's structure and navigation.
   - **`img` Tag:** Included an image with an `alt` attribute, improving accessibility and providing a visual element related to the content.
   - **`table` Tag:** Displayed the list of courses in a structured table format, making the information clearer and more organized.
   - **`footer` Tag:** Added a footer containing copyright information and a contact link, giving the page a proper conclusion and additional context.

## Design Achievements

### 1. **Color Palette**
   - Created a custom color palette using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/). The palette includes harmonious colors that are used throughout the webpage to create a consistent and aesthetically pleasing design.
   - **Color Usage:**
     - **Background Color:** Applied to the body of the page for a cohesive base.
     - **Text Colors:** Used across headings, paragraphs, and list items to maintain visual harmony and readability.
     - **Borders and Shadows:** Applied to certain elements to add depth and emphasis.
   - **Screenshot of Color Palette:** A screenshot of the Adobe Color wheel used to create the palette has been added to the project repository as `color-palette.jpg`.

### 2. **Google Fonts Integration**
   - Used the **Roboto** font from Google Fonts as the primary font for the website's text. This font was chosen for its clean and modern appearance, enhancing the overall design of the webpage.
   - The font was loaded via a link in the `<head>` section of the HTML and applied globally using CSS, ensuring a consistent typographic style throughout the site.
